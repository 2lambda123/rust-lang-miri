error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> is forbidden

LL |         *z = 2;
   |         ^^^^^^ write access through <TAG> is forbidden

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Frozen which forbids child write accesses
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL |     let z = &mut x as *mut i32;
   |             ^^^^^^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Active due to a child write access at offsets [0x0..0x4]

LL |         *z = 1;
   |         ^^^^^^
   = help: this corresponds to the first write to a 2-phase borrowed mutable reference
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Frozen due to a foreign read access at offsets [0x0..0x4]

LL |     x.do_bad();
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this corresponds to a loss of write permissions
